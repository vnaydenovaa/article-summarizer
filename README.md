### Contributing

This is a simple project that I'm doing as an intern. It's my first streamlit app and there are a lot of things that I'm eager to learn in the future. It's also the first repository I'm sharing publicly.

Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, you can  open an issue with the tag "suggestions". Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks you!
